Removing files

   rm -rf   Is a command used in a terminal or command-line interface to forcibly and recursively remove directories and files.  

The command stands for:

"rm" - which stands for "remove."
"-r" - which stands for "recursive," meaning the command will remove directories and their contents, including subdirectories and files within them.
"-f" - which stands for "force," and it is used to suppress any prompts or warnings, ensuring that the removal process happens without any interactive confirmation.
